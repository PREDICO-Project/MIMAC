Phantom Generation using VICTRE 
===============================

Here it is explained how we generate the voxelized phantoms using `VICTRE Pipeline <https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE_PIPELINE>`_ [3]. 

The VICTRE Pipline use Python to run the generation of the phantom and even a simulation of the projection using MCGPU.
