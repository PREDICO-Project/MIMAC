Pyr_Isotropic_dist
==================

This plugin has been created with the objective of increase the eficiency of the particle generation. This plugin modify the direction distribution of the initial particles to reduce the number of particles that will never reach the detector.

This distribution generates particles with a isotropic distribution colimated to reach the detector.
